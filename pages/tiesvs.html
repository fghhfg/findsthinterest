<p>Because of Jekyll’s flexibility, there are many solutions to how to do this.
One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory
called something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">assets</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">downloads</code>, into which any images, downloads
or other resources are placed. Then, from within any post, they can be linked
to using the site’s root as the path for the asset to include. Again, this will
depend on the way your site’s (sub)domain and path are configured, but here are
some examples (in Markdown) of how you could do this using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">site.url</code>
variable in a post.</p>
